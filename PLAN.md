# Tampil — Execution Plan

## Week 1-2: Validate Demand (Zero Cost)

### Goal: Get 5 sellers to say "yes I'd pay for this"

**Day 1-3: Prepare your pitch**
- Print 20 copies of a simple A4 flyer (before/after photo comparison)
  - Left: typical WhatsApp photo from a seller
  - Right: same product, shot properly (borrow any product, use ring light + white background at home)
  - Bottom: "5 foto produk GRATIS" + your WhatsApp number
- Set up WhatsApp Business account for Tampil
- Set up Instagram account @tampil.id — post 5-10 sample product photos

**Day 4-7: Walk Tanah Abang**
- Visit Blok A and Blok B (highest traffic for fashion)
- Target: talk to 30-40 sellers in 3-4 days
- Script: "Ibu/Pak, saya bisa foto produk Bapak/Ibu jadi seperti ini (show flyer). Mau coba 5 foto gratis?"
- Collect: name, WhatsApp number, what they sell, how many SKUs
- Note which sellers seem most interested and have the most product variety
- DO NOT pitch pricing yet — just offer free photos

**Day 8-14: Deliver free samples**
- Pick the 5 most promising sellers
- Collect 5 pieces each (25 total)
- Photograph at home: ring light, white poster board background, phone camera is fine
- Edit with Photoroom or Canva (free)
- Deliver photos via WhatsApp within 24 hours
- Ask: "Kalau mau lanjut, saya bisa Rp 25-35K per foto. Gimana?"

### What you learn:
- Do sellers actually care about better photos?
- What products are they selling? (hijab, gamis, kemeja, celana?)
- What's their price range?
- How tech-savvy are they?
- Where are they selling now? (only offline? Shopee? TikTok?)

### Pass/fail:
- **Pass**: 3+ sellers say "yes, I want more photos" → continue to Week 3
- **Fail**: Nobody cares → pivot (maybe they need store management more than photos, or a different market)

## Week 3-4: First Paying Customers

### Goal: 5 paying customers, Rp 2-3M revenue

**Setup (Day 1-2):**
- Buy basic equipment:
  - Ring light with stand: Rp 200-300K
  - White backdrop (2x3m fabric): Rp 50K
  - Tripod phone mount: Rp 100K
  - Total: ~Rp 500K
- You can work from home or any clean room for now — no studio needed yet
- Set up a simple booking flow: seller WhatsApps you → you schedule pickup/drop-off → deliver photos in 24hr

**Pricing (start low, raise later):**
- Rp 25K per SKU (flat lay / mannequin)
- Rp 50K per SKU (with model — use friends wearing hijab initially)
- Minimum order: 10 SKU
- First 5 photos free for new customers

**Operations:**
- Collect products in the morning (go to their shop or they drop at your location)
- Photograph in the afternoon (you should be able to do 30-50 flat lay SKUs per session)
- Edit in the evening (batch process with Photoroom or Lightroom presets)
- Deliver via WhatsApp/Google Drive by next morning

**Marketing:**
- Post every completed job on Instagram (before/after)
- Ask satisfied sellers to refer you to their neighbors
- Tanah Abang sellers talk — word of mouth is your #1 channel
- Print more flyers, leave stacks at warung/food stalls near the market

### Target:
| Metric | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|---|---|---|
| Customers | 3 | 5-8 |
| SKUs shot | 50 | 100-150 |
| Revenue | Rp 1.2M | Rp 2.5-4M |

## Month 2: Systemize and Add Services

### Goal: 15 recurring customers, Rp 8-12M revenue

**Hire your first person:**
- Part-time photographer/assistant: Rp 2-3M/month
- This person handles the daily photography while you focus on sales and seller relationships
- Train them on your exact workflow (lighting, angles, editing presets)

**Find a studio space:**
- Option A: Small kios inside/near Tanah Abang market: Rp 1.5-3M/month
  - Pros: sellers can walk in, builds trust
  - Cons: limited space
- Option B: Rented room nearby (Karet/Bendungan Hilir area): Rp 1-2M/month
  - Pros: cheaper, more space
  - Cons: less foot traffic
- You need: ~3x4m for backdrop, table for flat lay, storage shelf

**Add Tier 2: Store Management**
- Approach your best photo customers: "Mau saya bantu jualkan online juga?"
- Start with 2-3 sellers only
- Set up their Shopee/Tokopedia stores (or manage existing ones)
- Upload the products with your photos
- Charge: Rp 1.5-2M/month + 8% commission on sales
- This is where recurring revenue starts

**Improve photo quality:**
- Buy a proper mannequin: Rp 300-500K (ghost mannequin for tops)
- Upgrade to a real camera if budget allows, or use latest iPhone/Samsung
- Create a Lightroom preset for consistency — every photo looks "Tampil"

**Start AI automation pipeline:**
- Use Photoroom API or Remove.bg API for batch background removal
- Create templates in Canva for product description cards
- Set up Google Sheets to track: seller, SKUs, delivery date, payment status

### Revenue target:
| Stream | Customers | Monthly |
|---|---|---|
| Photography (Rp 30K avg x 50 SKU/seller) | 15 sellers | Rp 6-8M |
| Store management | 3 sellers | Rp 4.5-6M + commissions |
| **Total** | | **Rp 10-14M** |

### Costs:
| Item | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Assistant salary | Rp 2.5M |
| Studio rent | Rp 2M |
| Equipment/supplies | Rp 500K |
| Transport | Rp 500K |
| **Total** | **Rp 5.5M** |

**Profit: Rp 5-8M/month** — enough to validate and reinvest.

## Month 3: Add Model Shoots and Hijab Focus

### Goal: 25 customers, Rp 20M+ revenue

**Hire a part-time hijab model:**
- Budget: Rp 300-500K per shoot day
- 1 shoot day per week = 50-80 SKUs with model
- This is your premium tier (Rp 50-75K per SKU)
- Post all model photos on Instagram — this is your portfolio AND marketing

**Create the "Hijab Brand Package":**
- Bundle: 30 SKU model photos + brand name + logo + Shopee store setup
- Price: Rp 5M package
- Target: hijab sellers who want to go from grosir to brand
- This is high margin and positions you as a brand builder, not just a photographer

**Build case studies:**
- Track your best-performing managed stores
- Document: "Seller X went from 0 to 150 orders/month in 60 days"
- Use these numbers in every sales conversation
- Post on Instagram with seller's permission

**TikTok content:**
- Start posting behind-the-scenes of photoshoots
- "Before/after" transformation reels
- Interview sellers: "Dari grosir Rp 85K, sekarang jual Rp 219K"
- This content markets Tampil AND drives traffic to your managed stores

### Revenue target:
| Stream | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Photography (25 sellers) | Rp 12M |
| Store management (6 sellers) | Rp 9M + Rp 3M commissions |
| Brand packages (2) | Rp 10M |
| **Total** | **Rp 34M** |

## Month 4-6: Scale Operations

### Goal: 50+ sellers, Rp 50M+ revenue, hire team

**Team (5 people):**
| Role | Salary | Job |
|---|---|---|
| You | - | Sales, strategy, key accounts |
| Photographer 1 | Rp 3.5M | Daily flat lay + mannequin |
| Photographer 2 | Rp 3.5M | Model shoots + video |
| Store manager | Rp 4M | Manage all marketplace stores |
| Packer/QC | Rp 3M | Quality check + ship orders |
| **Total payroll** | **Rp 14M** | |

**Add fulfillment/QC service:**
- For your managed stores, offer end-to-end:
  - Order comes in → you pull product from seller's stock (stored at your studio)
  - QC check (inspect seams, color, sizing)
  - Pack with branded packaging
  - Ship via JNE/J&T/SiCepat
- Charge: Rp 5K per item fulfillment fee (on top of commission)
- This locks in sellers — hard to leave once you're handling their orders

**Upgrade studio:**
- Bigger space: 30-50m2
- Dedicated areas: photo zone, packing station, stock storage
- Multiple backdrop setups (white, lifestyle, colored)
- Budget: Rp 3-5M/month rent

**Revenue target Month 6:**
| Stream | Monthly |
|---|---|
| Photography (50 sellers) | Rp 25M |
| Store management (15 sellers) | Rp 22.5M + Rp 10M commissions |
| Brand packages (3/month) | Rp 15M |
| Fulfillment fees | Rp 8M |
| **Total** | **Rp 80M** |
| **Costs** | **Rp 35M** |
| **Profit** | **Rp 45M** |

## Month 7-12: Transition to Marketplace

This is where Tampil evolves from a service business into a product business.

### The Flip:

By month 6, you will have:
- 50+ seller relationships
- Thousands of product photos
- Sales data on what actually sells
- A QC + fulfillment operation
- A growing social media following

**Now launch your own storefront:**
- Create "Tampil" brand store on Shopee/Tokopedia/TikTok Shop
- Curate the top 200 products from your best sellers
- You buy at wholesale, sell at retail under the Tampil brand
- Use your existing photos, QC, and fulfillment
- Sellers don't care — they get wholesale volume from you either way

**Why this works:**
- You already know what sells (data from managed stores)
- You already have the photos
- You already have QC + fulfillment
- Zero additional infrastructure needed
- Margin jumps from 8% commission to 40-60% retail margin

## Key Metrics to Track Weekly

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| New sellers onboarded | Growth of supply |
| SKUs photographed | Production capacity |
| Revenue per seller | Are you extracting enough value? |
| Managed store GMV | Is online selling working? |
| Return rate | Is your QC working? |
| Seller churn | Are sellers sticking? |
| Instagram followers | Brand awareness |
| WhatsApp inquiries | Inbound demand |

## Total Investment Needed

| Phase | Timeframe | Investment | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validation | Week 1-2 | Rp 0 (just your time) | Rp 0 |
| Basic setup | Week 3-4 | Rp 500K (equipment) | Rp 500K |
| Studio + hire | Month 2 | Rp 5M (first month costs) | Rp 5.5M |
| Model + scale | Month 3 | Rp 3M (model + supplies) | Rp 8.5M |
| Team + bigger studio | Month 4-6 | Rp 20M (working capital) | Rp 28.5M |

**You should be profitable by Month 2 and self-funding growth from Month 3 onwards.**

The total startup cost of under Rp 30M is extremely low for a business with Rp 80M+/month revenue potential by Month 6.

---

## What NOT To Do

1. **Don't rent a studio before you have 5 paying customers.** Validate first.
2. **Don't build an app or website in Month 1.** WhatsApp + Instagram is enough.
3. **Don't hire before you've personally shot 200+ SKUs.** You need to know the workflow before you can teach it.
4. **Don't offer discounts.** Your free trial is 5 photos. After that, full price. Discounting signals low value.
5. **Don't take every seller.** Reject sellers with terrible products. Your reputation is your brand.
6. **Don't expand to other markets (Mangga Dua, ITC) before dominating Tanah Abang.** Go deep, not wide.
